## About
Bingr is a social media app in which users can swipe left or right on a movie and get matched with friends who swiped right on the same movies.  The front end is written for Android and the backend uses Springboot.

## Purpose 
This app was created for COM S 309 at Iowa State University with a team of 3 others.  This app was never intended for general use, but rather for educational purposes only.

## Demonstration 
Full demonstration of the features can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_YFvb-OJk).

## Notice
This project was originally hosted on a private Gitlab instance and moved here for archival purposes only.
